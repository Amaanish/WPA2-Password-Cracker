WPA2 Wi-Fi Password Cracker

This is a WPA2 handshake cracking tool that supports **dictionary**, **hybrid**, and **brute-force** attacks. It combines a powerful backend engine with a user-friendly GUI, allowing users to audit wireless network security through captured `.cap` files.
This was created for CSCI369 Project in collaboration with Yaasir Bin Muneer.

> This tool is for **educational and authorized penetration testing purposes only**. Unauthorized use against networks you don’t own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical.
